# LLM-Tokenizer

Byte-level BPE and shared conversation serialization.

Owns the BPE implementation wrapper and shared role/END protocol. train_bpe accepts text iterables; file-based helpers preserve the old API. Reserved IDs remain 0–7. It does not clean corpora or import Data. The production tokenizer remains outside this repository.

## Development

In the sibling workspace, use `../LLM-From-Scratch/run.py --repo LLM-Tokenizer test`.
This selects the existing environment and sibling package sources without installing dependencies.
For a separately installed checkout, run `python -m pytest` after provisioning the documented dependencies and exact sibling version 0.1.0. These packages are local and not published to PyPI.

## Entry points

- `python -m llm_tokenizer.cli.train_tokenizer --help`
- `python -m llm_tokenizer.cli.inspect_tokenizer --help`

## Integration and assets

`../LLM-From-Scratch/compatibility.json` records the complete tested version set.
Checkpoint weights, tokenizers, datasets and generated logs are referenced by path; none are distributed in this package. Preserve tokenizer fingerprints and architecture lineage. Source provenance is in PROVENANCE.md.

## Validation and limitations

See the central VALIDATION.md for commands, results and unverified large-model checks.
The original project is preserved unchanged. No model promotion, training pipeline or remote publishing occurs as part of extraction.

## Canonical workspace integration

This repository remains independently versioned at its existing remote and is pinned as a sibling in LLM-From-Scratch/compatibility.json. Integration decisions live in ../LLM-From-Scratch/documentation/training/SESSION_DECISIONS.md. Historical assets are external inputs; never commit weights, datasets or recovery snapshots.
